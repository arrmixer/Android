Android Development Big Nerd Ranch
This repository is the cumulation of all the projects and challenges within the Big Nerd Ranch Android Development book.
I branched out all the chapters and projects as neat as possible. The Master branch has the last app from the book called Loctr. Though the book did mentioned Third party libraries such as GSON, Picasso, and Glide, this book did all it's function natively within the Android/Java libraries. 

Here is a summary of the projects:

1. Quiz Acitivity App MVC Architecture
Go over basic functions of an Android app:
adding dependencies, intents, separate Activities, Lifecycle functions, Debugging, SDK's/Compatibilities, and going over layouts.

2. Criminal Intent App(Big one about 10 chapters) MVC Architecture
Continue the journey with Fragments, RecyclerView, Constraint Layout, DialogFragments, Widgets, Fragment Arguments, ViewPager, Impicit Intents, SQLite via SQLiteHelper class(Deprecated), Master-Detail Interface, Localization, and Content Descriptions. 

3. BeatBox App MVVM Architecture
This App introduced DataBinding and ViewModel using BaseObserable, Unit Testing, Styles and Themes, and XML Drawables.

4. NerdLaucher
This app expanding the idea of Intents whether implicit or explicit. It's role was to replace the Android's app launcher.

5. PhotoGallery (another big one) MVC Architecture
This app ulitilizes the Flickr api to display Photos via RecyclerView. It demostrated common Http requests and JSON parsing, Loopers, Handlers, HandlerThread, Shared Preferences, Intent Service, Broadcast Intents, and Webview.

6. DragAndDraw
Simple app used to demostrate Canvas, touch events, and simple Animations.

7. Loctr
Took the Flickr app and turn it into a location service. The app opened Google maps with the location of the photo. It demostrated an overview of the GooglePlay Library especially Maps. The overview included getting an location, drawing on the map, and how to deal with API keys within teams. 

8. No App just went over Material Design.
